    "All of the software you use on a regular basis is created through the use of programming languages. \n",
    "Programming languages allow us to write instructions to a computer. \n",
    "There are many different programming languages, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and uses. \n",
    "Some popular programming languages you might hear about are Javascript (used on the web - any website with interactive content likely uses javascript), Python (scientific programming and many other applications), C++ (high performance applications), SQL (databases), and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a computer programming language that has become ubiquitous in scientific programming and is growing in popularity across all domains of programming.\n",
    "The Python programming language was first introduced in the year 1991, and has grown to be one of the most popular programming languages for both scientists and non-scientists. \n",
    "According to the [2024 GitHub Report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/#the-most-popular-programming-languages), Python is the most popular programming languages for developers.\n",

    "Compared to other programming languages, Python is considered more intutitive to start learning and is also extremely versatile. \n",
    "Python is also very commonly used for applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n",
    "Notably, in contrast to some other languages commonly used in scientific programming, Python is **free and open-source**. \n",
    "This means anyone can download, install, and use Python.\n",
    "Python can be used to build web applications, interact with databases, and and to analyze data.\n",

    "## Python in Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used in many different scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, biology, and astronomy.\n",
    "Python is used in scientific programming for a variety of reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is free and open-source.\n",
    "* Python is easy to learn (compared to compiled programming languages like C++).\n",
    "* Python has a large community of users and developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scientific Python ecosystem is a set of packages commonly used for scientific applications. \n",
    "These packages are the foundation of scientific Python programming across a range of disciplines and include\n",
    "NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.\n",
    "In our workshop today, we will explore the basics of these foundational libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemistry specifically, there are a number of specialized libraries used for processing or analyzing chemical data. \n",
    "For example, there are many libraries for reading and writing chemical file formats, such as the [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) library. There are also libraries for cheminformatics, like RDKit, and libraries for quantum chemistry, like Psi4.\n",

Each indentation is 4 spaces by convention in Python 3. However, if you are using an editor which understands Python, it will do the correct indentation for you when you press the tab key on your keyboard. In fact, the Jupyter notebook will notice that you used a colon (`:`) in the previous line, and will indent for you (so you will not need to press tab).\n",
